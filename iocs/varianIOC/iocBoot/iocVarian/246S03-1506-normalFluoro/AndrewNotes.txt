Use this to take Varian image:
I put a shortcut on the desktop called "varian test app"
C:\Program Files\Varian\PaxscanL06\developer\VirtCpRel64\RadPanelTest64.exe

use option 3 to take an image, its the only one that will work. The rest wait for the 
varian detector to trigger an x-ray which never happens.

it will save them to 
C:\Program Files\Varian\PaxscanL06\developer\VirtCpRel64\_SavedImages

Use this info to open varian raw images in ImageJ:
16 bit Unsigned
