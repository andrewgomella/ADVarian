////////////////////////
General:
////////////////////////
.VIV filetype has 2048 byte header

you should call vip_io_enable() HS_STANDBY after each acq to reset the system
with hcpiorad.dll HS_ACTIVE enables receptor for one acquistion (but the handswitch has to be pressed??)

////////////////////////
Signal Notes:
////////////////////////

panel outputs "Expose OK" to announce it is ready for x-rays

Input "Expose Req" allows user to request an exposure (assumption is x-ray generator is ready to expose)

vip_set_user_sync
"intended for fluoro mode" :
when true, the user must apply hardware signal to start acq

////////////////////////
Fluoro notes:
////////////////////////
Images are only acquired while prepare is TRUE, and only saved to buffers if VALID_XRAY is true !!


////////////////////////
sw handshaking:
////////////////////////

VIP_SW_PREPARE = True tells panel to prepare for acquisition, false tells panel no more acquisition is expected(???) (only send after acq)
VP_SW_VALID_XRAYS = True tells panel that the xray is active , false tells panel acquistion is finished

After Exposure:
after each acquistion call HS_STANDBY to reset
vip_query_prog_info until RFP=1 and num frames = 0


////////////////////////
Varian Rad Correction:
////////////////////////
Varian's stored corrections all have a 2048 bit offset
Varian's gain has extra rows of pixels (can just ignore and put in normal size in imagej)

Start Acquistion:
Grab raw x-ray frame A -> Read out
Turn off x-ray
Grab dark field B-> Read out

Retrieve stored gain file C (which is already offset corrected!) from hard drive

Corrected image= (A-B) / (C)

End Acquisition

They also subtract out dead pixels and interpolate them


How is stored gain file Created?
We recommend that flat field images be acquired with a median count of 1,600 â€“ 3,000. 
This range will ensure that Gain calibration will meet both the upper and lower dose requirements under all modes of operation. 


First accumulates several dark fields (they recommend 8), after accumulation it averages them. 
Then x-ray is enabled, and as the panel reads out frames it dark field corrects them using the previous DF. 
It then accumulates the image in a buffer for the number of images requested (they recommend 32). When finished the frame is averaged. 


panel temperatures during test:

39.75 36.38 37.13 41.00 37.00 35.13


On the scale of several minutes:
no hint of artifacts when subtracting dark fields in 16 image acq over 4 minutes
